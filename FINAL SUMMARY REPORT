Final Summary Report
After the interview session, the bot will generate a detailed report that includes:
Areas of Strength: Highlights of the user's strong responses.
Areas to Improve: Constructive feedback on weaker answers.
Suggested Resources: Links to tutorials, articles, or courses for improvement.
Final Score: An overall rating (e.g., 8/10).
Streamlit provides an intuitive way to build interactive web applications. Here's how you can structure the UI
import streamlit as st

def display_summary_report(report_data):
    st.title("Interview Summary Report")
    
    st.header("Areas of Strength")
    st.write(report_data['strengths'])
    
    st.header("Areas to Improve")
    st.write(report_data['improvements'])
    
    st.header("Suggested Resources")
    for resource in report_data['resources']:
        st.write(f"- {resource}")
    
    st.header("Final Score")
    st.write(f"{report_data['score']}/10")
